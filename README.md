We believe that everyone has their creative ideas, which they can use to benefit themselves and at the same time expand the blockchain-based decentralized world.
Those who have studied generally in Computer Science may find it easier to put it into practice. But for others, who may be somewhat technically or technically ignorant,
those creative ideas remain elusive. So we are working on an AI-based project so that everyone can visualize their creative ideas and generate smart contracts accordingly. Creative ideas can easily be turned into a blockchain-based decentralized project using these generated portable smart contracts.

Our goal is to launch the open-source beta Version in mid-2021.
